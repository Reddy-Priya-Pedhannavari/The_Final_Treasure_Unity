# The Final Treasure

## Overview
The Final Treasure is a 2D action-adventure game developed using Unity and C#. Embark on a thrilling quest as a brave treasure hunter, facing mythical creatures, magical challenges, and collecting treasures and coins along the way.

## Game Story
You play as a man on a quest for a legendary treasure. On his journey, he encounters dangerous obstacles and enemies:

### Dinosaur Encounter:
Face a fierce dinosaur and defeat it using your choice of weapons—gun or knife.

### The Magical House:
Enter a mysterious house where a witch resides. As you attempt to exit, the witch attacks by throwing bombs. Overcome her magical onslaught to escape.

### The Dragon:
On the final stretch, a dragon blocks your path, spewing fireballs. Defeat the dragon, and the treasure appears where the dragon falls.

Collect extra coins along your journey for bonus points!
